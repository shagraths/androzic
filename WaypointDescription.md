Waypoint description is interpreted by Androzic as HTML. If you now HTML you can write it just in text edit box in advanced waypoint properties, or copy/paste it from some other location.

That particular waypoint description was created with much easier way: all waypoints where created in [Google My Maps](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/mymaps/create.html) - it supports rich text edit of point description - and then [imported](GoogleMapsPoints.md) via KML file.
