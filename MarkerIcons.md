Download `mapicons.zip` from Downloads section and unzip it in Androzic application folder (configured in Settings). Application folder will now contain `icons` folder with more then 630 marker icons in it. You can remove unnecessary icons if this is too much for you.

These marker icons are originally published on http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/ by Nicolas Mollet under Creative Commons 3.0 BY-SA license.

You can download updates or other styles from this site by yourself, just **keep `icons.dat` file intact** - it is part of Androzic, not icons collection.
