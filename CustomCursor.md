You can set custom moving cursor by placing a PNG file in Application folder (configured in Preferences). File must have name _cursor.png_ to be recognized by application. No checks are made to ensure that the file is a correct cursor image so it's all user own responsibility for this customization. Tested example cursor files can be found in Downloads section.
