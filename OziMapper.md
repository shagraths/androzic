OziMapper is a supplementary application for Androzic. It generates maps in native OziExplorer format from online sources (Open Street Map and similar). It also can just preload online map tiles on SD card for later use in Androzic without Internet connection.

**Known issues:**
  1. Current version generates map with only 100% scale. This may result in poor performance when zooming this map in Androzic.
  1. Time estimation during map generation is calculated inaccurately.
  1. Out of memory errors occur on some devices, if your is among them, please send crash report generated in SD card root.
  1. Tile cache and map paths are not configurable at the moment, defaults are used.
